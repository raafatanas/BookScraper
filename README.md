## Project Overview

This project scrapes book details from the [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) website. It extracts information from the *Travel* and *Nonfiction* book categories, including book name, price, rating, description, and other product details. The scraped data is saved into an Excel file (`books_data.xlsx`).
